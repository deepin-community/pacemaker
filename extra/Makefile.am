# "make check" will cause "make all" to be run, which means everything in this
# directory will get built as a part of running tests if it hasn't happened
# already.  That seems unnecessary, so override the default check-recursive
# rule with this one that just returns.  If we ever need to add tests to this
# directory, this rule will have to come out.
