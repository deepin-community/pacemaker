# Because tools/*.8.inc include a synopsis, the following line removes
# a redundant Usage: header from the man page and the couple lines after
# it.
/.SS "Usage:"/,+3d

# The tools/*.8.inc files also include some additional section headers
# on a per-tool basis.  These section headers will get printed out as
# .SH lines, but then the header from the --help-all output will also
# get turned into groff.  For instance, the following will be in the
# man page for NOTES:
#
# .SH NOTES
# .PP
# Notes:
# .PP
#
# The following block looks for any of those additional headers.  The
# 'n' command puts the next line in the pattern space, the two 'N'
# commands append the next two lines, and then the 'd' command deletes
# them.  So basically, this just deletes
#
# .PP
#  Notes:
# .PP
#
# This leaves the --help-all output looking good and removes redundant
# stuff from the man page.  Feel free to add additional headers here.
# Not all tools will have all headers.
