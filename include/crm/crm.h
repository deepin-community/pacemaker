 * \brief Allow use of deprecated Pacemaker APIs
 *
 * By default, external code using Pacemaker headers is allowed to use
 * deprecated Pacemaker APIs. If PCMK_ALLOW_DEPRECATED is defined to 0 before
 * including any Pacemaker headers, deprecated APIs will be unusable. It is
 * strongly recommended to leave this unchanged for production and release
 * builds, to avoid breakage when users upgrade to new Pacemaker releases that
 * deprecate more APIs. This should be defined to 0 only for development and
 * testing builds when desiring to check for usage of currently deprecated APIs.

 * The CRM feature set assists with compatibility in mixed-version clusters.
 * The major version number increases when nodes with different versions
 * would not work (rolling upgrades are not allowed). The minor version
 * number increases when mixed-version clusters are allowed only during
 * rolling upgrades (a node with the oldest feature set will be elected DC). The
 * minor-minor version number is ignored, but allows resource agents to detect
 * cluster support for various features.
 *
 * The feature set also affects the processing of old saved CIBs (such as for
 * many scheduler regression tests).
 *
 * Particular feature points currently tested by Pacemaker code:
 *
 * >2.1:     Operation updates include timing data
 * >=3.0.5:  XML v2 digests are created
 * >=3.0.8:  Peers do not need acks for cancellations
 * >=3.0.9:  DC will send its own shutdown request to all peers
 *           XML v2 patchsets are created by default
 * >=3.0.13: Fail counts include operation name and interval
 * >=3.2.0:  DC supports PCMK_LRM_OP_INVALID and PCMK_LRM_OP_NOT_CONNECTED
