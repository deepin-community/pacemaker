X-Common-Description: At its core, Pacemaker is a distributed finite state
 machine capable of co-ordinating the startup and recovery of inter-related
 services across a set of machines.
 .
 Pacemaker understands many different resource types (OCF, SYSV, systemd) and
 can accurately model the relationships between them (colocation, ordering).
 .
 It can even use technology such as Docker to automatically isolate the
 resources managed by the cluster.

Description: cluster resource manager proxy daemon for remote nodes
 ${S:X-Common-Description}
 .
 This package contains the Pacemaker proxy daemon, which simulates cluster
 services on a node not running the cluster stack.  Such "remote" nodes can
 run resources but don't participate in the quorum.  This package is
 mutually exclusive with Pacemaker proper.
