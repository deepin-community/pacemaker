A promoted resource instance takes the base priority + 1 on calculation if the base priority is not 0. Any static/random delays that are introduced by `pcmk_delay_base/max` configured for the corresponding fencing resources will be added to this delay. This delay should be significantly greater than, safely twice, the maximum `pcmk_delay_base/max`. By default, priority fencing delay is disabled.</longdesc>
