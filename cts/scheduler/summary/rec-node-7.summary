Current cluster status:
  * Node List:
    * Node node1: UNCLEAN (offline)
    * Online: [ node2 ]

  * Full List of Resources:
    * stonith-1	(stonith:dummy):	 Stopped
    * rsc1	(ocf:heartbeat:apache):	 Started node1 (UNCLEAN)
    * rsc2	(ocf:heartbeat:apache):	 Started node1 (UNCLEAN)

Transition Summary:
  * Fence (reboot) node1 'peer is no longer part of the cluster'
  * Start      stonith-1     (          node2 )
  * Move       rsc1          ( node1 -> node2 )
  * Move       rsc2          ( node1 -> node2 )

Executing Cluster Transition:
  * Resource action: stonith-1       monitor on node2
  * Resource action: rsc1            monitor on node2
  * Resource action: rsc2            monitor on node2
  * Fencing node1 (reboot)
  * Resource action: stonith-1       start on node2
  * Pseudo action:   rsc1_stop_0
  * Pseudo action:   rsc2_stop_0
  * Resource action: rsc1            start on node2
  * Resource action: rsc2            start on node2
