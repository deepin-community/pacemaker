Current cluster status:
  * Node List:
    * Node node2: UNCLEAN (online)
    * Online: [ node1 ]

  * Full List of Resources:
    * stonith-1	(stonith:dummy):	 Stopped
    * rsc1	(ocf:heartbeat:apache):	 FAILED node2
    * rsc2	(ocf:heartbeat:apache):	 Started node2

Transition Summary:
  * Fence (reboot) node2 'rsc1 failed there'
  * Start      stonith-1     (          node1 )
  * Recover    rsc1          ( node2 -> node1 )
  * Move       rsc2          ( node2 -> node1 )

Executing Cluster Transition:
  * Resource action: stonith-1       monitor on node1
  * Resource action: rsc1            monitor on node1
  * Resource action: rsc2            monitor on node1
  * Fencing node2 (reboot)
  * Resource action: stonith-1       start on node1
  * Pseudo action:   rsc1_stop_0
  * Pseudo action:   rsc2_stop_0
  * Resource action: rsc1            start on node1
