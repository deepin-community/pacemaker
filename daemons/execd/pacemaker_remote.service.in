# Systemd v227 and above can limit the number of processes spawned by a
# service. That is a bad idea for an HA cluster resource manager, so disable it
# by default. The administrator can create a local override if they really want
# a limit. If your systemd version does not support TasksMax, and you want to
# get rid of the resulting log warnings, comment out this option.
TasksMax=infinity

# If connected to the cluster and when the service functions properly, it will
# wait to exit until the cluster notifies it all resources on the remote node
# have been stopped.  The default of 30min should cover most typical cluster
# configurations, but it may need an increase to adapt to local conditions
# (e.g. a large, clustered database could conceivably take longer to stop).

# crm_perror() writes directly to stderr, so ignore it here
